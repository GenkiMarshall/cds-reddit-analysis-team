If I try to run mkfs.ext4 for /dev/sdc2 it says the same thing, except replacing .vfat with .ext4  Going to google, just wanted to update.  ---------------------------  EDIT: Hmm... maybe it's actually my USB drive that's causing the issues.  ----------------------------  EDIT #2: I was right!!!!! Using a different USB right now, and i got all the partitioning and making filesystem done!! and pacstrap seems to be going smoothly right now. So, now also the SSD is showing up each time I boot up with no problem, and you're right, it required quickly making a new format/partition as fast as I could so I could do that before it started yelling errors at me.  -----------------------------  EDIT #3: Okay, great I finished the beginner's guide, rebooted, and now I got the error \"secure boot violation invalid signature detected check secure boot policy in setup\". Googling now, as per https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=176882, turning off Secure Boot Control works, but as I said earlier, that makes the SSD unavailable (just tested, and now the BIOS shows no sign of any drive. So I just reset BIOS setting and powered off my computer and now going to wait a bit then going to turn it back on, because that's what historically has caused it to come back into view.)  ----------------------------  EDIT #4:  Hmm, seems like I need to follow this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Secure_Boot   ---------------------------  EDIT #5: Succcess!! I'm almost crying right now. This sounds so cheesy but I am so in gratitude. If you hadn't responded I was just going to return the laptop which would make me quite sad because I am in the middle of school and I can't wait longer (my current laptop is basically broken). And I really love this new laptop so far, besides this terrible secureboot thing, so yeah, your response led me to start trying things. I think the first step was convincining myself it was possible, which I didn't think before because I goofily thought that it was a driver problem. Thanks a million.  Anyway, the steps (this is all in effort to get secure boot to work).  I followed http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/secureboot.html#preloader For anyone who comes across this, I did the following steps to get secureboot working after all the above [gonna write a blog on this / add it to wiki when I get time]. Now, I'm going to give some steps on how I did it, but I really recommend reading through all the links instead of just blindly following, I'm just giving these to give a sense about how I actually made it work for this particular situation.  [So, at this point, all above is done, but when I try to boot in, it tells me about a secure boot violation]  So now, first boot into the live USB, and follow along (if you want reasons, please see see the above wiki article on UEFI secure boot, and also see the rodsbooks PreLoader section link above)  mount /dev/sda1 /mnt  mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot  cd /mnt/boot/EFI/gumniboot  cp /usr/lib/prebootloader/* ./  cp gummibootx64.efi loader.efi  arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash  cd /boot/EFI/gummiboot  efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 -l EFIgummibootPreLoader.efi -L PreLoader  Now, follow along from step 6 in rodsbooks' preloader section (I basically went HAM enrol'ing anything I could find that the HashTool would find and let me do). Not the most elegant thing, but at that point I was too afraid of missing something to not.  So, after doing this, I powered off, and rebooted, [using the PreLoader.efi boot from above] and it booted up perfectly ^_^  Note that at the end of the rodsbooks PreLoader link, it talks about probably having to do this HashTool process everytime a new linux kernel is downloaded. At least, that was my interpretation,I haven't done this yet, so I'm going to test next time a linux kernel upgrades and see.  ------------------------------------------  EDIT #6:  I literally cannot believe this. I am on such a rollercoaster right now. Systemd-journal started outputting tons of \"failed to write entry read only file system\"................... and so I powered off. And then i turned on my computer and it goes to BIOS and no boot entry shows up.  Bleh.  ------------------------------------------  EDIT #7:  Welp, no success. I am so done with this. I also just contacted Microsoft support and they said they would accept returns even if the Windows install has been replaced with linux. Thank the heavens.

I booted up the laptop again to check the output of lspci -vv. I typed lsblk and it showed the hard drive!! I was so excited. But then, after maybe 30 seconds, it output the message:  ata1: exception Emask 0x50 SAct0x0 SErr 0x4090800 action 0xe frozen  ata1: irq_stat 0x00400040, connection status changed  ata1: SError: { HostInt PHYRdyChg 10 B8B DevExch }  And so I ran dmesg to see what was up, and yeah it showed those 3 in red, and also the following right after it:  ata1: hard resetting link  ata1: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300)  ata1: hard resetting link  ata1: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300)  ata1: limiting SATA link speed to 1.5 Gbps  ata1: hard resetting link  ata1: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300)  ata1.00: disabled  ata1: EH complete  ata1.00: detaching (SCSI 0:0:0:0)  sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Synchronizing SCSI cache  sd 0:0:0:0: [sda]  Result: hostbyte=0x04 driverbyte=0x00  sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Stopping disk  sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] START_STOP FAILED  sd 0:0:0:0: [sda]  Result: hostbyte=0x04 driverbyte=0x00  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Anyway, I'm about to go google the above, just wanted to share that recent development. Okay, as for lspci -vv, I got this for my SATA controller:  SATA controller: Intel Corporation Wildcat Point-LP SATA Controller [Ahci Mode] (rev 03) (prog-if 01 [AHCI 1.0])  ...  Kernel driver in use: ahci  Kernel modules: ahci   Let me know if it would be helpful to see the rest of that output. So that seems like my driver guess was wrong, you're right, my guess really doesn't make sense now with a more cool head, thanks.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  And yes, this is from the live USB, confirmed.  Okay, I'm going to give Ubuntu 14.10 then Grml a shot, thanks for the encouragement.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  As for Windows, that's actually somewhat of a long story. Basically, I did at one point have access to the hard drive when I was in the liveUSB, and I got to after the point where I had formatted &amp; partitioned the hard drive, but due to circumstances I had to interrupt myself. And so when I powered it back on later, it got me to where I am now. It was quite silly to leave these details out, normally I'm better about my questions, so thanks for your patience.  -----------------------------------------  Also, just found this guy: https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/2zbtm2/asus_zenbook_ux305_for_windowsarch_dual_boot/cphknxp Who seemed to have a successfull install.", "kind": "t1", "upvote_ratio (links only)": null, "time_since_last_comment": null, "author": "genkito", "url": null, "kindnum_replies_before_this_reply": null, "created_utc": 1427349999.0, "subreddit": "archlinux", "urls_included": null, "is_first_comment_by_author_in_thread": null, "score": 2, "time_since_last_link": null, "time_since_last_link_or_comment": null, "num_replies_before_this_reply": 0, "response time": null, "is_reply_to_reply (comments only)": null, "id": "cpr4ofc"}]
